# 👩‍💻 Hello, World! I’m Maahi 🌸

> quietly crafting backends, writing clean logic, and building dreams in code.

## 💫 About Me

🌐 I'm a **Computers & Communications Engineering** student with a passion for elegant backend systems, clean APIs, and that satisfying moment when *everything just works*.

🔧 I build things with:
- `Python` (Flask, FastAPI)
- `MySQL` and other DBMS friends
- RESTful logic that keeps the chaos out and the flow in
- A good cup of chai and lo-fi playlists

💡 I believe that good code is like a quiet kind of poetry — structured, intentional, and just a little magical.

## 🔭 What I'm Working On
- Backend dev for personal and collab projects with my robotics nut [@thatsyogeshjjr](https://github.com/thatsyogeshjjr/) 🤖
- Exploring data systems, web security, and efficient architectures
- Slowly falling in love with DevOps (don’t tell Python)

## 📚 Current Learnings
- 📘 Flask & FastAPI deeper dives
- 📊 Data management + scalable systems
- 🛠️ CI/CD & Deployment pipelines

## ❤️ Fun Facts
- I believe tabs and spaces *can* coexist — peacefully.
- I love neat docs, expressive commits, and GitHub dark mode.
- When I’m not coding, I’m probably sending memes, helping debug silently, or listening to music that sounds like rainy windows.
